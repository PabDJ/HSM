# Hardware Security Module BLS Signer
Hardware Security Module implemented on Nordic nRF9160 and nRF5340 ARM Cortex-M33 based SoCs 

## Abstract
> This work is one of the 25 grantee projects from the Eth2 Staking Community Grants from Ethereum Foundation. The goal of this programme was to enhance the staking ecosystem while the new Ethereum network was being launched.
The objective is to help in blockchain’s scalability and to allow clients to return the requested block signature while listening to an API. Also, the execution of cryptographic operations in a secure environment such as a hardware security module contribute to improve the user’s trust in his work.
The implementation of this project has gone through two ways: one of them has been developed with a static library and the other one with source code files from Supranational blst library. Both works presented good results and they have shown that low-cost microcontrollers like nRF9160 DK board can succeed in challenging technologies such as Blockchain.

## Code
The code of the project can be found at [ETH 2.0 Hardware Remote Signer](https://github.com/decentralizedsecurity/bls-hsm)

## Technical report
The technical report is written in Spanish. The document attached is my Bachelor's thesis, which was graded with 9.5/10 and a distinction.
